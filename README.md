## 🔬 Bio
Hi there! I'm a passionate student in Computational Systems Biology, currently diving deep into a fascinating drug discovery project. With a strong foundation in Python, R, and Matlab, I enjoy applying these skills to solve complex biological problems.

## 🎓 Background
I hold a Master's Degree in Engineering with a specialization in Data Science. My academic journey has equipped me with a solid understanding of both the theoretical and practical aspects of data-driven technologies.

## 🤖 Interests
I'm particularly interested in the intersection of AI and machine learning with biological sciences. I believe that the future of healthcare and drug discovery lies in the smart integration of computational methods with traditional biological research.

## 🌐 On GitHub
My goal here is to collaborate on innovative projects and continuously enhance my skill set. I'm always open to learning and contributing to projects that are at the forefront of computational biology and data science.

## 📸 Beyond Code
When I'm not coding or studying, you can find me capturing the world through my camera lens, riding my motorcycle, exploring the automotive world, or immersed in the realm of gaming. These hobbies keep me creative and balanced.
